//The problem is to write a program that will grade multiple-choice tests. Assume there are eight students and ten questions, and the answers are stored in a two-dimensional array. 
//Each row records a studentâ€™s answers to the questions, as shown in the following array.
//Student 0  A  B  A  C  C   D  E  E  A  D
//Student 1  D  B  A  B  C  A   E  E  A  D
//Student 2  E  D  D  A  C  B   E  E  A  D
//Student 3  C  B  A  E  D  C   E  E  A  D
//Student 4  A  B  D  C  C  D  E  E  A   D
//Student 5  B  B  E  C   C  D  E  E  A  D
//Student 6  B  B  A  C  C  D  E   E  A  D
//Student 7  E  B  E  C  C   D  E  E  A  D
